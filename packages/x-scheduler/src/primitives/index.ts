// This folder folder contains all the primitives used in the Joy UI scheduler.
// Those primitives are not meant for public usage for now.
// In the future, they might either:
// - Be extracted into a standalone package branded as Base UI Scheduler (or Base UI X Scheduler)
// - Remain in the scheduler package but be publicly exposed
// - Remain internal
