# Docs end-to-end testing

## Running locally

1. Run `pnpm docs:dev` to start docs in development server.
2. Run `pnpm test:e2e-website` in a separate terminal to run the test suites (`*.spec.ts`) inside `test/e2e-website` folder.

> use --headed to run tests in headed browsers, check out [Playwright CLI](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro#command-line) for more options

## CI
