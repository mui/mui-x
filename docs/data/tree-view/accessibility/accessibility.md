# Accessibility

<p class="description">Learn how the Tree View implements accessibility features and guidelines, including keyboard navigation that follows international standards.</p>

## Guidelines

Common conformance guidelines for accessibility include:

- Globally accepted standard: [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)
- US:
  - [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/) - US Department of Justice
  - [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) - US federal agencies
- Europe: [EAA](https://employment-social-affairs.ec.europa.eu/policies-and-activities/social-protection-social-inclusion/persons-disabilities/union-equality-strategy-rights-persons-disabilities-2021-2030/european-accessibility-act_en) (European Accessibility Act)

WCAG 2.1 has three levels of conformance: A, AA, and AAA.
Level AA exceeds the basic criteria for accessibility and is a common target for most organizations, so this is what we aim to support.

The [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/treeview/) provide valuable information on how to optimize the accessibility of a Tree View.

## Keyboard interactions

:::info
The key assignments in the table below apply to Windows and Linux users.

On macOS replace <kbd class="key">Ctrl</kbd> with <kbd class="key">âŒ˜ Command</kbd>.

Some devices may lack certain keys, requiring the use of key combinations. In this case, replace:

- <kbd class="key">Home</kbd> with <kbd class="key">Fn</kbd>+<kbd class="key">Arrow Left</kbd>
- <kbd class="key">End</kbd> with <kbd class="key">Fn</kbd>+<kbd class="key">Arrow Right</kbd>

Type-ahead is supported for single characters. When typing a character, focus moves to the next item with a label that starts with the typed character.

## Selection

The Tree View supports both single and multi-selection. To learn more about the selection API, visit the dedicated page for the [Simple Tree View](/x/react-tree-view/simple-tree-view/selection/) or the [Rich Tree View](/x/react-tree-view/rich-tree-view/selection/).

To read more about the distinction between selection and focus, you can refer to the [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/keyboard-interface/#kbd_focus_vs_selection).

### On single-select trees

When a single-select tree receives focus:

- If none of the items are selected when the tree receives focus, focus is set on the first item.
- If an item is selected before the tree receives focus, focus is set on the selected item.

| ---------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| <kbd class="key">Space</kbd> | Selects the focused item.                                    |
| <kbd class="key">Enter</kbd> | Selects the focused item if the item does not have children. |

### On multi-select trees

When a multi-select tree receives focus:

- If none of the items are selected when the tree receives focus, focus is set on the first item.
- If one or more items are selected before the tree receives focus, then focus is set on:
  - the first selected item if it is the first render
  - the item that was last selected otherwise
