# Date Range Picker [<span class="plan-pro"></span>](/x/introduction/licensing/#pro-plan 'Pro plan')

<p class="description">The Date Range Picker lets the user select a range of dates.</p>

## Basic usage

{{"demo": "BasicDateRangePicker.js"}}

## Component composition

The component is built using the `MultiInputDateRangeField` for the keyboard editing and the `DateRangeCalendar` for the view editing.

Check-out their documentation page for more information:

- [Date Range Field](/x/react-date-pickers/date-range-field/)
- [Date Range Calendar](/x/react-date-pickers/date-range-calendar/)

You can check the available props of the combined component on the dedicated [API page](/x/api/date-pickers/date-range-picker/#props).
Some [MultiInputDateRangeField props](/x/api/date-pickers/multi-input-date-range-field/#props) are not available on the Picker component, you can use `slotProps.field` to pass them to the field.

## Uncontrolled vs. controlled value

The value of the component can be uncontrolled or controlled.

{{"demo": "DateRangePickerValue.js"}}

:::info

- The value is **controlled** when its parent manages it by providing a `value` prop.
- The value is **uncontrolled** when it is managed by the component's own internal state. This state can be initialized using the `defaultValue` prop.

Learn more about the _Controlled and uncontrolled_ pattern in the [React documentation](https://react.dev/learn/sharing-state-between-components#controlled-and-uncontrolled-components).
:::

## Available components

The component is available in four variants:

- The `DesktopDateRangePicker` component which works best for mouse devices and large screens.
  It renders the views inside a popover and a field for keyboard editing.

- The `MobileDateRangePicker` component which works best for touch devices and small screens.
  It renders the view inside a modal and does not allow editing values with the keyboard in the field.

- The `DateRangePicker` component which renders `DesktopDateRangePicker` or `MobileDateRangePicker` depending on the device it runs on.

- The `StaticDateRangePicker` component which renders without the popover/modal and field.

{{"demo": "ResponsiveDateRangePickers.js"}}

By default, the `DateRangePicker` component renders the desktop version if the media query [`@media (pointer: fine)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/pointer) matches.
This can be customized with the `desktopModeMediaQuery` prop.

:::warning
Responsive components can suffer some inconsistencies between testing environments if media query is not supported.
Please refer to [this section](/x/react-date-pickers/base-concepts/#testing-caveats) for solutions.
:::

## Form props

The component can be disabled or read-only.

{{"demo": "FormPropsDateRangePickers.js"}}

## Customization

### Render 1 to 3 months

You can render up to 3 months at the same time using the `calendars` prop.

:::info
This prop will be ignored on the mobile picker.
:::

{{"demo": "DateRangePickerCalendarProp.js"}}

### Use a single input field

You can pass the `SingleInputDateRangeField` component to the Date Range Picker to use it for keyboard editing.
In such case the Picker component can pass the `name` prop to the input.

{{"demo": "SingleInputDateRangePicker.js"}}

:::info
You can find more information in a [dedicated documentation page section](/x/react-date-pickers/custom-field/#use-single-input-fields-on-range-pickers).
:::

### Add shortcuts

To simplify range selection, you can add [shortcuts](/x/react-date-pickers/shortcuts/#range-shortcuts).

{{"demo": "BasicRangeShortcuts.js", "bg": "inline", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

### Customize the field

You can find the documentation in the [Custom field page](/x/react-date-pickers/custom-field/).
