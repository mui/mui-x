# Date Range Picker [<span class="plan-pro"></span>](https://mui.com/store/items/mui-x-pro/)

<p class="description">Date pickers let the user select a range of dates.</p>

The date range pickers let the user select a range of dates.

## Basic usage

Note that you can pass almost any prop from [DatePicker](/x/react-date-pickers/date-picker/).

{{"demo": "BasicDateRangePicker.js"}}

## Static mode

It's possible to render any picker inline. This will enable building custom popover/modal containers.

{{"demo": "StaticDateRangePickerDemo.js", "bg": true}}

## Responsiveness

The date range picker component is designed to be optimized for the device it runs on.

- The `MobileDateRangePicker` component works best for touch devices and small screens.
- The `DesktopDateRangePicker` component works best for mouse devices and large screens.

By default, the `DateRangePicker` component renders the desktop version if the media query [`@media (pointer: fine)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/pointer) matches.
This can be customized with the `desktopModeMediaQuery` prop.

## Form props

The date range picker component can be disabled or read-only.

{{"demo": "FormPropsDateRangePickers.js"}}

## Different number of months

Note that the `calendars` prop only works in desktop mode.

{{"demo": "CalendarsDateRangePicker.js"}}

## Disabling dates

Disabling dates behaves the same as the simple `DatePicker`.

{{"demo": "MinMaxDateRangePicker.js"}}

## Custom input component

You can customize the rendered input with the `renderInput` prop. For `DateRangePicker` it takes **2** parameters – for start and end input respectively.
If you need to render custom inputs make sure to spread `ref` and `inputProps` correctly to the input components.

{{"demo": "CustomDateRangeInputs.js"}}

## Customized day rendering

The displayed days are customizable with the `renderDay` function prop.
You can take advantage of the internal [DateRangePickerDay](/x/api/date-pickers/date-range-picker-day/) component.
