<p class="description">How to get support for MUI X components, including feature requests, bug fixes, answers to how-to questions, and technical support from the team.</p>

## GitHub

We use GitHub issues as a bug and feature request tracker.
If you think you've found a bug, or you have a new feature idea, please start by [making sure it hasn't already been reported or fixed](https://github.com/mui/mui-x/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aclosed).
You can search through existing issues and pull requests to see if someone has reported one similar to yours.

[Open an issue](https://github.com/mui/mui-x/issues/new/choose) in the MUI X repo.

## Stack Overflow

Visit Stack Overflow to ask questions and read crowdsourced answers from expert developers in the MUI community, as well as MUI maintainers.

[Post a question about MUI X](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mui-x) on Stack Overflow using the "mui-x" tag.

## Technical support

:::info
The technical support covers only MUI X components.
:::

When purchasing a MUI X Pro or Premium license you get access to technical support until the end of your subscription.
Support is available on multiple channels, but the recommended channels are:

- GitHub: You can [open a new issue](https://github.com/mui/mui-x/issues/new/choose) and leave your Order ID (or Support key), so we can prioritize accordingly.
- Email: If you need to share **private information** you can [submit a request](https://support.mui.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?tf_360023797420=mui_x) or send an email to [x@mui.com](mailto:x@mui.com).

Including your Order ID (or Support key) in the issue helps us prioritize the issues based on the following support levels:

1. MUI X Pro: maintainers give these issues more attention than the ones from the community.
2. MUI X Premium: The same as MUI X Pro, but with higher priority.
3. MUI X Priority support add-on (coming soon): Provides a 24h SLA for the first answer.
