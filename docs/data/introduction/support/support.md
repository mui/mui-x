# Support

<p class="description">Learn how to get support for MUI¬†X components, including feature requests, bug fixes, and technical support from the team.</p>

## GitHub

We use GitHub issues as a bug and feature request tracker.

If you think you've found a bug, or you have a new feature idea:

1. Please start by [making sure it hasn't already been reported or fixed](https://github.com/mui/mui-x/issues?q=is%3Aissue).
   You can search through existing issues and pull requests to see if someone has reported one similar to yours.
2. Then, if no duplicates exist, [open an issue](https://github.com/mui/mui-x/issues/new/choose) in the MUI¬†X repository.

### New issue guidelines

- Please follow one the issue templates provided on GitHub.
- Please begin the title with "[component-name]" (if relevant), and use a succinct description that helps others find similar issues.
  - ‚ùå _"It doesn't work"_
  - ‚úÖ _"[button] Add support for {{new feature}}"_
- Please don't group multiple topics in one issue.
- Please don't comment "+1" on an issue. It spams the maintainers and doesn't help move the issue forward. Use GitHub reactions instead (üëç).

### Bug reproductions

We require bug reports to be accompanied by a **minimal reproduction**.
It significantly increases the odds of fixing the problem.
You have a few possible options to provide it:

#### Use the live editors

You can browse the documentation, find an example close to your use case, and then open it in a live editor:

<a href="/x/react-date-pickers/getting-started/#render-your-first-component">
<span class="only-light-mode">
<img src="/static/docs-infra/forking-an-example.png" alt="Forking an example" loading="lazy" width="1628" height="700" style="display: block; max-width: 774px;">
</span>
<span class="only-dark-mode">
<img src="/static/docs-infra/forking-an-example-dark.png" alt="Forking an example" loading="lazy" width="1628" height="700" style="display: block; max-width: 774px;">
</span>
</a>

- [Date Pickers](/x/react-date-pickers/getting-started/#render-your-first-component)
- [Charts](/x/react-charts/getting-started/#self-contained-charts)
- [Tree View](/x/react-tree-view/#simple-tree-view)

#### Use starter templates

You can use a starter template to build a reproduction case with:

<!-- #default-branch-switch -->

- A minimal Data Grid [TypeScript template](https://stackblitz.com/github/mui/mui-x/tree/master/bug-reproductions/x-data-grid?file=src/index.tsx)
- A plain React [JavaScript](https://stackblitz.com/github/stackblitz/starters/tree/main/react) or [TypeScript](https://stackblitz.com/github/stackblitz/starters/tree/main/react-ts) template

## Stack¬†Overflow

We use Stack¬†Overflow for how-to questions. Answers are crowdsourced from expert developers in the MUI¬†X community as well as MUI¬†X maintainers.

You can search through existing questions and answers to see if someone has asked a similar question using one of [these tags](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mui-x+or+mui-x-charts+or+mui-x-data-grid+or+mui-x-date-picker):

- mui-x
- mui-x-data-grid
- mui-x-date-picker
- mui-x-charts

If you cannot find your answer, [ask a new question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=reactjs%20mui-x) using the relevant tags.

## Technical support

:::info
The technical support covers only MUI¬†X components.
:::

When purchasing a MUI¬†X Pro or Premium license you get access to technical support until the end of your active license.
Support is available on multiple channels, but the recommended channels are:

- GitHub: You can [open a new issue](https://github.com/mui/mui-x/issues/new/choose) and leave your Order ID (or Support key), so we can prioritize accordingly.
- Email: If you need to share **private information** you can [submit a request](https://support.mui.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?tf_360023797420=mui_x) or send an email to [x@mui.com](mailto:x@mui.com).

Including your Order ID (or Support key) in the issue helps us prioritize the issues based on the following support levels:

1. MUI¬†X Pro: maintainers give these issues more attention than the ones from the community.
2. MUI¬†X Premium: The same as MUI¬†X Pro, but with higher priority.
3. MUI¬†X Priority Support add-on (coming soon): Provides a 24h SLA for the first answer.

## Long-term support (LTS)

Bug fixes, performance enhancements, and other improvements are delivered in new releases.
However, we remain committed to providing security updates and addressing regressions for the immediate predecessor of the current major version.

This includes issues introduced by external sources, like browser upgrades or changes to upstream dependencies.

## Custom work

If your team gets stuck and needs help getting unblocked, MUI¬†X's engineers may be available on a contract basis.

Keep in mind that the work must be directly related to MUI¬†X's products‚Äîwe don't accept general web development or React work.

Our contracting price starts at $200/hour or $1,500/day.

[Send us an email](mailto:custom-work@mui.com) summarizing of your needs, and we'll let you know whether we can help (or else try to suggest alternatives).
