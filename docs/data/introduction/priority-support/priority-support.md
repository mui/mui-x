<p class="description">Learn more about the priority support services that MUI offers to Premium license holders.</p>

## What is priority support?

The MUI X team offers priority support as an add-on service for Premium license holders.
With priority support you get expedited assistance and troubleshooting for your critical applications, ensuring the fastest possible resolution times.

Unlike MUI X's standard support services—which are provided to all Pro and Premium license holders and only cover MUI X components—priority support covers the entire MUI ecosystem, including Material UI and Base UI.

### Why teams choose priority support

Priority support is tailored for enterprise teams who rely on the MUI ecosystem at scale and want faster turnaround on bug reports, closer collaboration on issue triaging, and coverage across the entire component library.

Priority support covers _all_ MUI products, including:

- The entire MUI X suite: Data Grid, Date and Time Pickers, Tree View, and Charts
- Material UI
- Base UI
- MUI System
- Pigment CSS
- Joy UI

### Service-level agreement (SLA)

Priority support is governed by a service-level agreement (SLA) that ensures:

- **24-hour response times**: Priority support requests receive an initial response within one business day.
- **Four-hour pre-screenings**: Priority requests undergo a review of up to four hours to validate and reproduce the issues.
- **Issue escalation**: Critical issues are escalated to senior engineers for focused attention and prompt resolutions.

For complete details, see our [SLA for technical support](https://mui.com/legal/technical-support-sla/).

### How MUI prioritizes support requests

Support requests are prioritized based on the type of license the developer holds:

1. Premium license with priority support (SLA-governed)
2. Premium license with standard support (no SLA)
3. Pro license
4. Community (free) license

## How to purchase priority support

Priority support is available as an add-on for Premium users.
Please [contact our support team](mailto:support@mui.com) to purchase.

Community and Pro users must upgrade to a Premium license to purchase priority support.

## How to use priority support

MUI accept priority support requests through two main channels: the public repositories on GitHub (preferred), and our private support system on Zendesk.

### Public repositories

When submitting a priority support request on GitHub, please follow these instructions to ensure your request is handled in a timely manner:

1. Depending on the product you need support for, visit either the [MUI X](https://github.com/mui/mui-x) or the [Material UI](https://github.com/mui/material-ui) repo.
2. Create a new issue using the **Priority support: SLA ⏰** template—this ensures it will include the necessary labels to trigger our automated process.
3. After you've created the issue, a GitHub action will prompt you to follow an external link to validate your support key (which was issued to you upon purchase).

Once your support key is validated, the action comment will update to confirm that your SLA is now in effect, and the issue labels will update accordingly to alert our team to review your request as soon as possible.

### Private support desk

If your request includes sensitive information that you can't share publicly, you can [submit a support request](https://support.mui.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to us through Zendesk instead.
