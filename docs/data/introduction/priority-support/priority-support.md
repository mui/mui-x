# Priority Support

<p class="description">Learn how to get priority technical support for MUI components.</p>

## What is priority support?

Priority support is a paid MUI offering that guarantees an expedited technical support experience for your critical apps. It offers quick troubleshooting and priority treatment of your queries.

Priority support gets a higher precedence over standard support which comes by default with the paid plans. It is governed by an SLA while the others are not. Our support team caters to the user queries in the following order:

:::info
Community < Pro < Premium Standard (No SLA) < Priority Support (SLA governed)
:::

The SLAs included in priority support are:

- **24 hour response SLA**
  Receive an initial response from our support team within 24 business hours.
- **4 hour pre-screening SLA**
  Issues submitted through priority support channels undergo an initial review to validate, and reproduce the issue. This ensures your tickets have the right information for debugging.
- **Issue Escalation**
  Critical issues are escalated to senior engineers for focused attention and faster resolutions.

## How to use priority support?

### On GitHub

- You'll go to either [mui-x](https://github.com/mui/mui-x) or [material-ui](https://github.com/mui/material-ui) repo and use the "**Priority support: SLA ⏰**" issue template to create a new issue invoking the Priority support SLA.
- Once the issue is created it will have the following labels: [status: needs triage](https://github.com/mui/mui-x/labels/status%3A%20needs%20triage), [support: commercial](https://github.com/mui/mui-x/labels/support%3A%20commercial), [support: unknown](https://github.com/mui/mui-x/labels/support%3A%20unknown)
- A GitHub action will prompt you to follow an external link leading to a validation app where you need to validate your support key.
- Once your support key is successfully validated the labels in the issue will update to the following: [status: needs triage](https://github.com/mui/mui-x/labels/status%3A%20needs%20triage), [support: commercial](https://github.com/mui/mui-x/labels/support%3A%20commercial), [support: priority](https://github.com/mui/mui-x/labels/support%3A%20priority)
- The GitHub action will update the previous comment with the following: `Thank you for verifying your support key 🔑, your SLA starts now.` Thus marking the start of the SLA.
- Then the support team will check the issue and respond within the SLA.
