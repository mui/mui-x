# Migration from v6 to v7

<p class="description">This guide describes the changes needed to migrate the Data Grid from v6 to v7.</p>

## Introduction

This is a reference guide for upgrading `@mui/x-data-grid` from v6 to v7.
To read more about the changes from the new major, check out [the blog post about the release of MUIÂ X v7](https://mui.com/blog/mui-x-v7-beta/).

## Start using the new release

In `package.json`, change the version of the Data Grid package to `^7.0.0`.

```diff
-"@mui/x-data-grid": "^6.0.0",
+"@mui/x-data-grid": "^7.0.0",

-"@mui/x-data-grid-pro": "^6.0.0",
+"@mui/x-data-grid-pro": "^7.0.0",

-"@mui/x-data-grid-premium": "^6.0.0",
+"@mui/x-data-grid-premium": "^7.0.0",
```

Since v7 is a major release, it contains changes that affect the public API.
These changes were done for consistency, improved stability and to make room for new features.
Described below are the steps needed to migrate from v6 to v7.

## Update `@mui/material` package

To have the option of using the latest API from `@mui/material`, the package peer dependency version has been updated to `^5.15.14`.
It is a change in minor version only, so it should not cause any breaking changes.
Please update your `@mui/material` package to this or a newer version.

## Update the license package

If you're using the commercial version of the Data Grid ([Pro](/x/introduction/licensing/#pro-plan) and [Premium](/x/introduction/licensing/#premium-plan) plans), you need to update the import path:

```diff
-import { LicenseInfo } from '@mui/x-license-pro';
+import { LicenseInfo } from '@mui/x-license';
```

If you have `@mui/x-license-pro` in the `dependencies` section of your `package.json`, rename and update the license package to the latest version:

```diff
-"@mui/x-license-pro": "^6.0.0",
+"@mui/x-license": "^7.0.0",
```

## Run codemods

The `preset-safe` codemod will automatically adjust the bulk of your code to account for breaking changes in v7.
You can run `v7.0.0/data-grid/preset-safe` targeting only Data Grid or `v7.0.0/preset-safe` to target other MUIÂ X components like the Date and Time pickers as well.

You can either run it on a specific file, folder, or your entire codebase when choosing the `<path>` argument.

<!-- #default-branch-switch -->

```bash
# Data Grid specific
npx @mui/x-codemod@latest v7.0.0/data-grid/preset-safe <path>

# Target other MUIÂ X components as well
npx @mui/x-codemod@latest v7.0.0/preset-safe <path>
```

:::info
If you want to run the codemods one by one, check out the codemods included in the [preset-safe codemod for the Data Grid](https://github.com/mui/mui-x/blob/HEAD/packages/x-codemod/README.md#preset-safe-for-data-grid-v700) for more details.
:::

Breaking changes that are handled by `preset-safe` codemod are denoted by a âœ… emoji in the table of contents on the right side of the screen or next to the specific point that is handled by it.

If you have already applied the `v7.0.0/data-grid/preset-safe` (or `v7.0.0/preset-safe`) codemod, then you should not need to take any further action on these items. If there's a specific part of the breaking change that is not part of the codemod or needs some manual work, it will be listed in the end of each section.

All other changes must be handled manually.

:::warning
Not all use cases are covered by codemods. In some scenarios, like props spreading, cross-file dependencies, etc., the changes are not properly identified and therefore must be handled manually.

For example, if a codemod tries to rename a prop, but this prop is hidden with the spread operator, it won't be transformed as expected.

```tsx
<DataGrid {...newProps} />
```

After running the codemods, make sure to test your application and that you don't have any console errors.

Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/mui/mui-x/issues/new/choose) for support if you need help to proceed with your migration.

## Breaking changes

Since v7 is a major release, it contains some changes that affect the public API.
These changes were done for consistency, improve stability and make room for new features.
Below are described the steps you need to make to migrate from v6 to v7.

### Drop the legacy bundle

The support for IEÂ 11 has been removed from all MUIÂ X packages.
The `legacy` bundle that used to support old browsers like IEÂ 11 is no longer included.

:::info
If you need support for IEÂ 11, you will need to keep using the latest version of the `v6` release.
:::

### Drop webpack 4 support

Dropping old browsers support also means that we no longer transpile some features that are natively supported by modern browsers â€“ like [Nullish Coalescing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Nullish_coalescing) and [Optional Chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining).

These features are not supported by webpack 4, so if you are using webpack 4, you will need to transpile these features yourself or upgrade to webpack 5.

Here is an example of how you can transpile these features on webpack 4 using the `@babel/preset-env` preset:

```diff
 // webpack.config.js

 module.exports = (env) => ({
   // ...
   module: {
     rules: [
       {
         test: /\.[jt]sx?$/,
-        exclude: /node_modules/,
+        exclude: [
+          {
+            test: path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules'),
+            exclude: [
+              // Covers @mui/x-data-grid, @mui/x-data-grid-pro, and @mui/x-data-grid-premium
+              path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/@mui/x-data-grid'),
+              path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/@mui/x-license'),
+            ],
+          },
+        ],
       },
     ],
   },
 });
```

### DOM changes

The Data Grid's layout has been substantially altered to use CSS sticky positioned elements.
As a result, the following changes have been made:

- The main element now corresponds to the virtual scroller element.
- Headers are now contained in the virtual scroller.
- Pinned row and column sections are now contained in the virtual scroller.
- The cell inner wrapper `.MuiDataGrid-cellContent` has been removed.

## Renamed props

- The props `rowBuffer` and `columnBuffer` were renamed to `rowBufferPx` and `columnBufferPx`.
  Their value is now a pixel value rather than a number of items. Their default value is now `150`.

### Removed props

- âœ… The deprecated props `components` and `componentsProps` have been removed. Use `slots` and `slotProps` instead. See [components section](/x/react-data-grid/components/) for more details.
- The `slots.preferencesPanel` slot and the `slotProps.preferencesPanel` prop were removed. Use `slots.panel` and `slotProps.panel` instead.
- The `getOptionValue` and `getOptionLabel` props were removed from the following components:

  - `GridEditSingleSelectCell`
  - `GridFilterInputSingleSelect`
  - `GridFilterInputMultipleSingleSelect`

  Use the `getOptionValue` and `getOptionLabel` properties on the `singleSelect` column definition instead:

  ```tsx
  const column: GridColDef = {
    type: 'singleSelect',
    field: 'country',
    valueOptions: [
      { code: 'BR', name: 'Brazil' },
      { code: 'FR', name: 'France' },
    ],
    getOptionValue: (value: any) => value.code,
    getOptionLabel: (value: any) => value.name,
  };
  ```

- The props `rowThreshold` and `columnThreshold` have been removed.
  If you had the `rowThreshold` prop set to `0` to force new rows to be rendered more often â€“ this is no longer necessary.
- âœ… Some feature flags were removed from the `experimentalFeatures` prop. These features are now stable and enabled by default:
  - [`columnGrouping`](/x/react-data-grid/column-groups/)
  - [`clipboardPaste`](/x/react-data-grid/clipboard/#clipboard-paste)
  - [`lazyLoading`](/x/react-data-grid/row-updates/#lazy-loading)

### Behavioral changes

The disabled column specific features like `hiding`, `sorting`, `filtering`, `pinning`, `row grouping`, etc., can now be controlled programmatically using `initialState`, respective controlled models, or the [API object](/x/react-data-grid/api-object/).

Here's the list of affected features, column definition flags and props to disable them, and the related props and API methods to control them programmatically.

{{"demo": "ColDefChangesGridNoSnap.js", "bg": "inline", "hideToolbar": true}}

### State access

Some selectors now require passing `instanceId` as a second argument:

```diff
-gridColumnFieldsSelector(apiRef.current.state);
+gridColumnFieldsSelector(apiRef.current.state, apiRef.current.instanceId);
```

However, it's preferable to pass the `apiRef` as the first argument instead:

```js
gridColumnFieldsSelector(apiRef);
```

See the [Direct state access](/x/react-data-grid/state/#direct-selector-access) page for more info.

<!-- ### Events

- -->

### Columns

- The `GridColDef['type']` has been narrowed down to only accept the built-in column types.
  TypeScript users need to use the `GridColDef` interface when defining columns:

  ```tsx
  // ðŸ›‘ `type` is inferred as `string` and is too wide
  const columns = [{ type: 'number', field: 'id' }];
  <DataGrid columns={columns} />;

  // âœ… `type` is `'number'`
  const columns: GridColDef[] = [{ type: 'number', field: 'id' }];
  <DataGrid columns={columns} />;

  // âœ… Alternalively, `as const` can be used to narrow down the type
  const columns = [{ type: 'number' as const, field: 'id' }];
  <DataGrid columns={columns} />;
  ```

- The type `GridPinnedColumns` has been renamed to `GridPinnedColumnFields`.

- The type `GridPinnedPosition` has been renamed to `GridPinnedColumnPosition`.

- The column grouping API methods `getColumnGroupPath` and `getAllGroupDetails` are no longer prefixed with `unstable_`.

- The column grouping selectors `gridFocusColumnGroupHeaderSelector` and `gridTabIndexColumnGroupHeaderSelector` are no longer prefixed with `unstable_`.

- The columns management component has been redesigned and the component is extracted from the `ColumnsPanel` which now only serves as a wrapper to display the component over the headers as a panel. As a result, a new slot `columnsManagement`, and corresponding prop `slotProps.columnsManagement` have been introduced. The props corresponding to the columns management component which were previously passed to the prop `slotProps.columnsPanel` should now be passed to `slotProps.columnsManagement`. `slotProps.columnsPanel` could still be used to override props corresponding to the `Panel` component used in `ColumnsPanel` which uses [`Popper`](/material-ui/react-popper/) component under the hood.

```diff
 <DataGrid
  slotProps={{
-   columnsPanel: {
+   columnsManagement: {
      sort: 'asc',
      autoFocusSearchField: false,
    },
  }}
 />
```

- `Show all` and `Hide all` buttons in the `ColumnsPanel` have been combined into one `Show/Hide All` checkbox in the new columns management component. The related props `disableShowAllButton` and `disableHideAllButton` have been replaced with a new prop `disableShowHideToggle`.

- The signature of `GridColDef['valueGetter']` has been changed for performance reasons:

  ```diff
  -valueGetter: ({ value, row }) => value,
  +valueGetter: (value, row, column, apiRef) => value,
  ```

  The `GridValueGetterParams` interface has been removed:

  ```diff
  -const customValueGetter = (params: GridValueGetterParams) => params.row.budget;
  +const customValueGetter: GridValueGetterFn = (value, row) => row.budget;
  ```

- The signature of `GridColDef['valueFormatter']` has been changed for performance reasons:

  ```diff
  -valueFormatter: ({ value }) => value,
  +valueFormatter: (value, row, column, apiRef) => value,
  ```

  The `GridValueFormatterParams` interface has been removed:

  ```diff
  -const gridDateFormatter = ({ value, field, id }: GridValueFormatterParams<Date>) => value.toLocaleDateString();
  +const gridDateFormatter: GridValueFormatter = (value: Date) => value.toLocaleDateString();
  ```

- The signature of `GridColDef['valueSetter']` has been changed for performance reasons:

  ```diff
  -valueSetter: (params) => {
  -  const [firstName, lastName] = params.value!.toString().split(' ');
  -  return { ...params.row, firstName, lastName };
  -}
  +valueSetter: (value, row) => {
  +  const [firstName, lastName] = value!.toString().split(' ');
  +  return { ...row, firstName, lastName };
  +}
  ```

  The `GridValueSetterParams` interface has been removed:

  ```diff
  -const setFullName = (params: GridValueSetterParams) => {
  -  const [firstName, lastName] = params.value!.toString().split(' ');
  -  return { ...params.row, firstName, lastName };
  -};
  +const setFullName: GridValueSetter<Row> = (value, row) => {
  +  const [firstName, lastName] = value!.toString().split(' ');
  +  return { ...row, firstName, lastName };
  +}
  ```

- The signature of `GridColDef['valueParser']` has been changed for performance reasons:

  ```diff
  -valueParser: (value, params: GridCellParams) => value.toLowerCase(),
  +valueParser: (value, row, column, apiRef) => value.toLowerCase(),
  ```

- The signature of `GridColDef['colSpan']` has been changed for performance reasons:

  ```diff
  -colSpan: ({ row, field, value }: GridCellParams) => (row.id === 'total' ? 2 : 1),
  +colSpan: (value, row, column, apiRef) => (row.id === 'total' ? 2 : 1),
  ```

- The signature of `GridColDef['pastedValueParser']` has been changed for performance reasons:

  ```diff
  -pastedValueParser: (value, params) => new Date(value),
  +pastedValueParser: (value, row, column, apiRef) => new Date(value),
  ```

- The signature of `GridColDef['groupingValueGetter']` has been changed for performance reasons:

  ```diff
  -groupingValueGetter: (params) => params.value.name,
  +groupingValueGetter: (value: { name: string }, row, column, apiRef) => value.name,
  ```

### Density

- The `density` is a [controlled prop](/x/react-data-grid/accessibility/#set-the-density-programmatically) now, if you were previously passing the `density` prop to the Data Grid, you will need to do one of the following:

1. Move it to the `initialState.density` to initialize it.

```diff
 <DataGrid
-  density="compact"
+  initialState={{ density: "compact" }}
 />
```

2. Move it to the state and use `onDensityChange` callback to update the `density` prop accordingly for it to work as expected.

```diff
 const [density, setDensity] = React.useState<GridDensity>('compact');
 <DataGrid
-  density="compact"
+  density={density}
+  onDensityChange={(newDensity) => setDensity(newDensity)}
 />
```

- The selector `gridDensityValueSelector` was removed, use the `gridDensitySelector` instead.

<!-- ### Rows

- -->

<!-- ### `apiRef` methods

- -->

### Clipboard

- âœ… The clipboard related exports `ignoreValueFormatterDuringExport` and `splitClipboardPastedText` are not anymore prefixed with `unstable_`.

### Print export

- The print export will now only print the selected rows if there are any.
  If there are no selected rows, it will print all rows. This makes the print export consistent with the other exports.
  You can [customize the rows to export by using the `getRowsToExport` function](/x/react-data-grid/export/#customizing-the-rows-to-export).

### Selection

- âœ… The `unstable_` prefix has been removed from the cell selection props listed below.

  | Old name                              | New name                     |
  | :------------------------------------ | :--------------------------- |
  | `unstable_cellSelection`              | `cellSelection`              |
  | `unstable_cellSelectionModel`         | `cellSelectionModel`         |
  | `unstable_onCellSelectionModelChange` | `onCellSelectionModelChange` |

- The `unstable_` prefix has been removed from the cell selection API methods listed below.

  | Old name                           | New name                  |
  | :--------------------------------- | :------------------------ |
  | `unstable_getCellSelectionModel`   | `getCellSelectionModel`   |
  | `unstable_getSelectedCellsAsArray` | `getSelectedCellsAsArray` |
  | `unstable_isCellSelected`          | `isCellSelected`          |
  | `unstable_selectCellRange`         | `selectCellRange`         |
  | `unstable_setCellSelectionModel`   | `setCellSelectionModel`   |

### Filtering

- The `getApplyFilterFnV7` in `GridFilterOperator` has been renamed to `getApplyFilterFn`.
  If you use `getApplyFilterFnV7` directly - rename it to `getApplyFilterFn`.

- The signature of the function returned by `getApplyFilterFn` has changed for performance reasons:

```diff
 const getApplyFilterFn: GetApplyFilterFn<any, unknown> = (filterItem) => {
   if (!filterItem.value) {
     return null;
   }

   const filterRegex = new RegExp(escapeRegExp(filterItem.value), 'i');
-  return (cellParams) => {
-    const { value } = cellParams;
+  return (value, row, colDef, apiRef) => {
     return value != null ? filterRegex.test(String(value)) : false;
   };
 }
```

- The `getApplyQuickFilterFnV7` in `GridColDef` was renamed to `getApplyQuickFilterFn`.
  If you use `getApplyQuickFilterFnV7` directly - rename it to `getApplyQuickFilterFn`.

- The signature of the function returned by `getApplyQuickFilterFn` has changed for performance reasons:

```diff
 const getGridStringQuickFilterFn: GetApplyQuickFilterFn<any, unknown> = (value) => {
   if (!value) {
     return null;
   }
   const filterRegex = new RegExp(escapeRegExp(value), 'i');
-  return (cellParams) => {
-    const { formattedValue } = cellParams;
+  return (value, row, column, apiRef) => {
+    let formattedValue = apiRef.current.getRowFormattedValue(row, column);
     return formattedValue != null ? filterRegex.test(formattedValue.toString()) : false;
   };
 };
```

- The Quick Filter now ignores hidden columns by default.
  See [Including hidden columns](/x/react-data-grid/filtering/quick-filter/#including-hidden-columns) section for more details.

- The header filters feature is now stable. `unstable_` prefix is removed from prop `headerFilters` and the following exports.

  | Old name                                          | New name                                 |
  | :------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------- |
  | `unstable_gridFocusColumnHeaderFilterSelector`    | `gridFocusColumnHeaderFilterSelector`    |
  | `unstable_gridHeaderFilteringEditFieldSelector`   | `gridHeaderFilteringEditFieldSelector`   |
  | `unstable_gridHeaderFilteringMenuSelector`        | `gridHeaderFilteringMenuSelector`        |
  | `unstable_gridHeaderFilteringStateSelector`       | `gridHeaderFilteringStateSelector`       |
  | `unstable_gridTabIndexColumnHeaderFilterSelector` | `gridTabIndexColumnHeaderFilterSelector` |

- The filter panel no longer uses the native version of the [`Select`](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-select/) component for all components.
- The `filterModel` now supports `Date` objects as values for `date` and `dateTime` column types.
  The `filterModel` still accepts strings as values for `date` and `dateTime` column types,
  but all updates to the `filterModel` coming from the UI (for example filter panel) will set the value as a `Date` object.

### Accessibility

- âœ… The `ariaV7` experimental flag has been removed and the Data Grid now uses the improved accessibility implementation by default.
  If you were using the `ariaV7` flag, you can remove it from the `experimentalFeatures` prop:

  ```diff
  -<DataGrid experimentalFeatures={{ ariaV7: true }} />
  +<DataGrid />
  ```

  The most notable changes that might affect your application or tests are:

  - The `role="grid"` attribute along with related ARIA attributes are now applied to the inner `div` element instead of the root `div` element:

    ```diff
    -<div class="MuiDataGrid-root" role="grid" aria-colcount="5" aria-rowcount="101" aria-multiselectable="false">
    +<div class="MuiDataGrid-root">
       <div class="MuiDataGrid-toolbarContainer"></div>
    -    <div class="MuiDataGrid-main"></div>
    +    <div class="MuiDataGrid-main" role="grid" aria-colcount="5" aria-rowcount="101" aria-multiselectable="false"></div>
       <div class="MuiDataGrid-footerContainer"></div>
     </div>
    ```

  - When [Tree data](/x/react-data-grid/tree-data/) feature is used, the grid role is now `role="treegrid"` instead of `role="grid"`.
  - The Data Grid cells now have `role="gridcell"` instead of `role="cell"`.

### Editing

- The `rowEditCommit` event and the related prop `onRowEditCommit` was removed. The [`processRowUpdate`](/x/react-data-grid/editing/#the-processrowupdate-callback) prop can be used in its place.

### Other exports

- The import path for locales has been changed:

  ```diff
  -import { enUS } from '@mui/x-data-grid';
  +import { enUS } from '@mui/x-data-grid/locales';

  -import { enUS } from '@mui/x-data-grid-pro';
  +import { enUS } from '@mui/x-data-grid-pro/locales';

  -import { enUS } from '@mui/x-data-grid-premium';
  +import { enUS } from '@mui/x-data-grid-premium/locales';
  ```

- The deprecated constants `SUBMIT_FILTER_STROKE_TIME` and `SUBMIT_FILTER_DATE_STROKE_TIME` are no longer exported.
  Use the [`filterDebounceMs`](/x/api/data-grid/data-grid/#data-grid-prop-filterDebounceMs) prop to customize filter debounce time.

- The `GridPreferencesPanel` component is not exported anymore as it wasn't meant to be used outside of the Data Grid.

- The buttons in toolbar composable components `GridToolbarColumnsButton`, `GridToolbarFilterButton`, `GridToolbarDensity`, and `GridToolbarExport` are now wrapped with a tooltip component and have a consistent interface. In order to override some props corresponding to the toolbar buttons or their corresponding tooltips, you can use the `slotProps` prop. Following is an example diff. See [Toolbar section](/x/react-data-grid/components/#toolbar) for more details.

```diff
 function CustomToolbar() {
  return (
    <GridToolbarContainer>
      <GridToolbarColumnsButton />
      <GridToolbarFilterButton
-       title="Custom filter" // ðŸ›‘ This was previously forwarded to the tooltip component
+       slotProps={{ tooltip: { title: 'Custom filter' } }} // âœ… This is the correct way now
      />
      <GridToolbarDensitySelector
-       variant="outlined"    // ðŸ›‘ This was previously forwarded to the button component
+       slotProps={{ button: { variant: 'outlined' } }} // âœ… This is the correct way now
      />
    </GridToolbarContainer>
  );
 }
```

### CSS classes and styling

- You can now style a row's hover state using just `:hover` instead of `.Mui-hovered`.
- The `.MuiDataGrid--pinnedColumns-(left\|right)` class for pinned columns has been removed.
- The `.MuiDataGrid-cell--withRenderer` class has been removed.
- The cell element isn't `display: flex` by default. You can add `display: 'flex'` on the column definition to restore the behavior.

  **NOTE**: If you're using **dynamic row height**, this also means cells aren't vertically centered by default anymore, you might want to set the `display: 'flex'` for all non-dynamic columns. This may also affect text-ellipsis, which you can restore by adding your own wrapper with `text-overflow: ellipsis`.

  ```tsx
  {
    display: 'flex',
    renderCell: ({ value }) => (
      <div style={{ overflow: 'hidden', textOverflow: 'ellipsis' }}>
        {value}
      </div>
    ),
  },
  ```

- The `columnHeader--showColumnBorder` class was replaced by `columnHeader--withLeftBorder` and `columnHeader--withRightBorder`.
- The `columnHeadersInner`, `columnHeadersInner--scrollable`, and `columnHeaderDropZone` classes were removed since the inner wrapper was removed in our effort to simplify the DOM structure and improve accessibility.
- The `pinnedColumnHeaders`, `pinnedColumnHeaders--left`, and `pinnedColumnHeaders--right` classes have been removed along with the element they were applied to.
  The pinned column headers now use `position: 'sticky'` and are rendered in the same row element as the regular column headers.
- The column headers and pinned section now require an explicit color. By default, the MUI `theme.palette.background.default` color will be used. To customize it, see https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/palette/#customization
  We will be adding a new color name to the palette for additional customization, read [#12443](https://github.com/mui/mui-x/issues/12443) for more details.

### Changes to the public API

- The method `getRootDimensions()` now returns a non-null value.
- The field `mainElementRef` is now always non-null.
- The field `rootElementRef` is now always non-null.
- The field `virtualScrollerRef` is now always non-null.
- The event `renderedRowsIntervalChange` params changed from `GridRenderedRowsIntervalChangeParams` to `GridRenderContext`, and the former has been removed.

### Changes to slots

- The slot `columnHeaders` has had these props removed: `columnPositions`, `densityFactor`, `minColumnIndex`.
- The slot `row` has had these props removed: `containerWidth`, `position`.
- The slot `row` has typed props now.
- The slot `headerFilterCell` has had these props removed: `filterOperators`.
- All slots are now strongly typed, previously were `React.JSXElementConstructor<any>`.

<!-- ### Rename `components` to `slots` -->
