# Charts - Axis

<p class="description">Axis provides associate values to element positions.</p>

Axes are used in the following charts: `<LineChart />`, `<BarChart />`, `<ScatterChart />`.

## Defining axis

Like your data, axis definition plays a central role in the chart rendering.
It's responsible for the mapping between your data and element positions.

You can define custom axes by using `xAxis` and `yAxis` props.
Those props expect an array of objects.

Here is a demonstration with two lines with the same data.
But one uses a linear, and the other a log axis.
Each axis definition is identified by its property `id`.
Then each series specifies the axis they use with the `xAxisId` and `yAxisId` properties.

{{"demo": "ScaleExample.js"}}

:::info
The management of those ids is for advanced use cases, such as charts with multiple axes.
Or customized axes.

If you do not provide a `xAxisId` or `yAxisId`, the series will use the first axis defined.

That's why in most of the demonstrations with single x and y axis you will not see definitions of axis `id`, `xAxisId`, or `yAxisId`.
Those demonstrations use the defaultized values.
:::

### Axis type

The axis type is specified by its property `scaleType` which expect one of the following values:

- `'band'`: Split the axis in equal band. Mostly used for bar charts.
- `'point'`: Split the axis in equally spaced points. Mostly used for line charts on categories.
- `'linear'`, `'log'`, `'sqrt'`: Map numerical values to the space available for the chart. `'linear'` is the default behavior.
- `'time'`, `'utc'`: Map JavaScript `Date()` object to the space available for the chart.

### Axis data

The axis definition object also includes a `data` property.
Which expects an array of value coherent with the `scaleType`:

- For `'linear'`, `'log'`, or `'sqrt'` it should contain numerical values
- For `'time'` or `'utc'` it should contain `Date()` objects
- For `'band'` or `'point'` it can contain `string`, or numerical values

Some series types also require specific axis attributes:

- line plots require an `xAxis` to have `data` provided
- bar plots require an `xAxis` with `scaleType="band"` and some `data` provided.

### Axis formatter

Axis data can be displayed in the axes ticks and the tooltip.
To modify how data is displayed use the `valueFormatter` property.

The second argument of `valueFormatter` provides some rendering context for advanced use cases.

In the next demo, `valueFormatter` is used to shorten months and introduce a breaking space for ticks only.
To distinguish tick and tooltip, it uses the `context.location`.

{{"demo": "FormatterDemoNoSnap.js"}}

### Axis sub domain

By default, the axis domain is computed such that all your data is visible.
To show a specific range of values, you can provide properties `min` and/or `max` to the axis definition.

```js
xAxis={[
  {
    min: 10,
    max: 50,
  },
]}
```

{{"demo": "MinMaxExample.js"}}

### Relative axis subdomain

You can adjust the axis range relatively to its data by using the `domainLimit` option.
It can take 3 different values:

- `"nice"` Rounds the domain at human friendly values. It's the default behavior.
- `"strict"` Sets the domain to the min/max value to display.
- `([minValue, maxValue]) => [min, max]` Receives the calculated extremums as parameters, and should return the axis domain.

The demo below shows different ways to set the y-axis range.
They always display the same data, going from -15 to 92, but with different `domainLimit` settings.

{{"demo": "CustomDomainYAxis.js"}}

### Axis direction

By default, the axes' directions are left to right and bottom to top.
You can change this behavior with the property `reverse`.

{{"demo": "ReverseExampleNoSnap.js"}}

## Grid

You can add a grid in the background of the cartesian chart with the `grid` prop.

It accepts an object with `vertical` and `horizontal` properties.
Setting those properties to `true` will display the grid lines.

If you use composition you can pass those properties to the `<ChartsGrid />` component.

```jsx
<BarChart grid={{ vertical: true }}>

<ChartContainer>
  <ChartsGrid vertical >
</ChartContainer>
```

{{"demo": "GridDemo.js"}}

## Tick position

### Automatic tick position

You can customize the number of ticks with the property `tickNumber`.

:::info
This number is not the exact number of ticks displayed.

Thanks to d3, ticks are placed to be human-readable.
For example, ticks for time axes will be placed on special values (years, days, half-days, ...).

If you set `tickNumber=5` but there are only 4 years to display in the axis, the component might choose to render ticks on the 4 years, instead of putting 5 ticks on some months.
:::

As a helper, you can also provide `tickMinStep` and `tickMaxStep` which will compute `tickNumber` such that the step between two ticks respect those min/max values.

Here the top axis has a `tickMinStep` of half a day, and the bottom axis a `tickMinStep` of a full day.

{{"demo": "TickNumber.js"}}

### Fixed tick positions

If you want more control over the tick position, you can use the `tickInterval` property.

This property accepts an array of values.
Ticks will be placed at those values.

For axis with scale type `'point'`, the `tickInterval` property can be a filtering function of the type `(value, index) => boolean`.

In the next demo, both axes are with `scaleType='point'`.
The top axis displays the default behavior.
It shows a tick for each point.
The bottom axis uses a filtering function to only display a tick at the beginning of a day.

{{"demo": "TickPosition.js"}}

### Filtering ticks label

You can display labels only on a subset of ticks with the `tickLabelInterval` property.
It's a filtering function in the `(value, index) => boolean` form.

For example `tickLabelInterval: (value, index) => index % 2 === 0` will show the label every two ticks.

:::warning
The `value` and `index` arguments are those of the ticks, not the axis data.
:::

By default, ticks are filtered such that their labels do not overlap.
You can override this behavior with `tickLabelInterval: () => true` which forces showing the tick label for each tick.

In this example, the top axis is a reference for the default behavior.
Notice that tick labels do not overflow.

At the bottom, you can see one tick for the beginning and the middle of the day but the tick label is only displayed for the beginning of the day.

{{"demo": "TickLabelPosition.js"}}

## Axis customization

You can further customize the axis rendering besides the axis definition.

### Fixing overflow issues

If your tick labels are too long, they can either overflow the SVG or overlap with the axis label.
Resolving this can be achieved in two ways:

- Increase the space between the SVG border and the axis by setting the [margin props](/x/react-charts/styling/#placement).
- Modify the axis label position by:
  - Using the axis configuration `labelStyle.transform`.
  - Applying CSS transform to the class name `axisClasses.label`.

In the following demo, the margin is modified to provide more space to the x and y axes.
The x-axis label placement is based on the axis configuration, and the y-axis is placed using a CSS selector.

{{"demo": "MarginAndLabelPosition.js"}}

### Position

Charts components provide 4 props: `topAxis`, `rightAxis`, `bottomAxis`, and `leftAxis` allowing to define the 4 axes of the chart.
Those props can accept three type of value:

- `null` to not display the axis
- `string` which should correspond to the id of a `xAxis` for top and bottom. Or to the id of a `yAxis` for left and right.
- `object` which will be passed as props to `<XAxis />` or `<YAxis />`. It allows to specify which axis should be represent with the `axisId` property, and to customize the design of the axis.

The demo below uses `leftAxis={null}` to remove the left axis, and `rightAxis={{}}` to set a right axis without overriding the default y-axis configuration.

{{"demo": "ModifyAxisPosition.js"}}

### Hiding axis

To hide an axis, set it to `null`.
For example `leftAxis={null}` hides the left axis.

{{"demo": "HidingAxis.js"}}

### Rendering

Axes rendering can be further customized. Below is an interactive demonstration of the axis props.

{{"demo": "AxisCustomizationNoSnap.js", "hideToolbar": true, "bg": "playground"}}

### Text customization

To customize the text elements (ticks label and the axis label) use the `tickLabelStyle` and `labelStyle` properties of the axis configuration.

{{"demo": "AxisTextCustomizationNoSnap.js", "hideToolbar": true, "bg": "playground"}}

## Composition

If you are using composition, you have to provide the axis settings in the `<ChartContainer />` by using `xAxis` and `yAxis` props.

It will provide all the scaling properties to its children, and allows you to use `<XAxis/>` and `<YAxis/>` components as children.
Those components require an `axisId` prop to link them to an axis you defined in the `<ChartContainer />`.

You can choose their position with `position` props which accept `'top'`/`'bottom'` for `<XAxis />` and `'left'`/`'right'` for `<YAxis />`.
Other props are similar to the ones defined in the [previous section](/x/react-charts/axis/#rendering).

{{"demo": "AxisWithComposition.js"}}

### Reference line

The `<ChartsReferenceLine />` component add a reference line to the charts.
You can provide an `x` or `y` prop to get a vertical or horizontal line respectively at this value.

You can add a `label` to this reference line.
It can be placed with `labelAlign` prop which accepts `'start'`, `'middle'`, and `'end'` values.
Elements can be styled with `lineStyle` and `labelStyle` props.

{{"demo": "ReferenceLine.js"}}
