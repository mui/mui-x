<p class="description">Sankey charts are great for visualizing flows between different elements.</p>

## Basics

The Sankey chart series must contain a `data` property containing an object with `nodes` and `links`.
Each node can have an optional configuration object, and links must specify `source`, `target`, and `value`.

{{"demo": "SankeyChartExample.js"}}

## Data structure

The Sankey chart requires a specific data structure with two main parts: `nodes` and `links`.

- The `nodes` array is optional but allows you to customize individual nodes.
- The `links` array defines the connections between nodes.

### Automatic nodes

If a node is referenced in links but not defined in the `nodes` array, it will be automatically created with the ID as the label.

### Explicit nodes

When you provide explicit node definitions, you can customize labels and colors for each node.

## Styling

### Default node styles

You can apply default styles to all nodes using the `nodeOptions` prop:

### Default link styles

You can apply default styles to all links using the `linkOptions` prop:

### Node alignment

Control how nodes are positioned within the chart:
