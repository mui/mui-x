## Line with forecast

To show that parts of the data have different meanings, you can render stylised lines for each of them.

In the following example, the chart shows a dotted line to exemplify that the data is estimated.
To do so, the `slots.line` is set with a custom components that render the default line twice.

- The first one is clipped to show known values (from the left of the chart to the limit).
- The second one is clipped to show predictions (from the limit to the right of the chart) with dash styling.

## CustomLineMarks

Notice that using another shape than "circle" renders a `<path />` instead of the `<circle />` for mark elements.
This modification implies a small drop of rendering performances (around +50ms to render 1.000 marks).
