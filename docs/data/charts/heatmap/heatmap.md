# Charts - Heatmap [<span class="plan-pro"></span>](/x/introduction/licensing/#pro-plan 'Pro plan')

<p class="description">Heatmap charts visually represents data with color variations to highlight patterns and trends across two dimensions.</p>

## Basics

The Heatmap requires two axes with `data` properties.
Those data defined the x and y categories.

The series `data` is an array of 3-tuples.
The 2 first numbers are respectively the x and y indexes of the cell.
And the third is its value.

## Customization

### Color mapping

To customize the color mapping, use the `zAxis` configuration.
You can either use the piecewise or continuous [color mapping](https://mui.com/x/react-charts/styling/#values-color).

### Highlight

You can chose to highlight the hovered element by setting `highlightScope.highlight` to `'item'`.
To fade the other item, set `highlightScope.fade` to `'global'`.

{{"demo": "HighlightHeatmap.js"}}

By default highlighted/faded effect is obtained by applying the CSS property `filter: saturate(...)` to cells.
To modify this styling, use the `heatmapClasses.highlighted` and `heatmapClasses.faded` CSS classes to override the applied style.

In the following demo, we replace the highlight saturation by a border radius and reduce the saturation of the faded cells.
