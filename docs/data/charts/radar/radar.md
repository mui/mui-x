# Charts - Radar ðŸš§

<p class="description">Radar allows to compare multivariate data in a 2D chart.</p>

:::warning
ðŸš§ This component is under development ðŸš§

Not all the feature are implemented and its API might change in the future if needed to integrate the upcoming features.
:::

## Basics

A radar chart is defined by two main props:

- The `series` prop which provides the values to display thanks to the `data` property.
- The `radar` prop which defines the radar axes.

{{"demo": "BasicRadar.js"}}

## Multi-series

You can plot multiple series on the same radar chart.

{{"demo": "MultiSeriesRadar.js"}}

## Axis

The `metrics` property of `radar` takes an array with one item per corner of the radar.
This item can either be:

- A string used as the axis label. The other properties are populated from the data.
- An object with the following properties:
  - `name`: The label associated to the axis.
  - `min`: The minimum value along this direction (by default 0).
  - `max`: The maximum value along this direction (by default the maximum value along this direction).

{{"demo": "RadarAxis.js" }}

## Grid

The radar chart displays a grid behind the series that can be configured with:

- `startAngle` The rotation angle of the entire chart in degrees.
- `divisions` The number of divisions of the grid.
- `shape` The grid shape that can be `circular` or `sharp`.

## Interaction ðŸš§

### Axis click ðŸš§

### Item click ðŸš§

## Highlight ðŸš§

### Axis Highlight

By default the radar highlight values of a same axis.
This axis highlight has two visualizations available with the prop `axisHighlightShape`:

- `'points'` Displays points on each highlighted value (best with multiple series).
- `'slice'` Displays a slice around the highlighted value. (best with a single series).

With composition you can add this behavior with the `<RadarAxisHighlight axisHighlightShape='slice' />` component.

{{"demo": "DemoRadarAxisHighlight.js" }}

## Tooltip ðŸš§

## Composition ðŸš§

For composition, use the `RadarDataProvider` to provide `series` and `radar` props.

Providing components for radar composition is still a work in progress.
If you miss some element or explanation, please open an issue describing what you want to achieve, and what is missing.

In this example, we uses `RadarSeriesArea` and `RadarSeriesMarks` to modify the order of the elements:
all the marks are on top of all the path.
Additionaly, we apply different properties based on the series id.
