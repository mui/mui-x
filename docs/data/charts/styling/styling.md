# Charts - Styling

<p class="description">This page groups topics about charts customization.</p>

## Colors

### Series color

Series accepts a property `color` which is the base color used to render its components.

```jsx
<LineChart series={[{ ..., color: '#fdb462'}]} />
```

{{"demo": "BasicColor.js"}}

### Color palette

Charts come with built-in color palettes to automatically assign colors to series.
If a particular series lacks a color prop, the chart will default to assigning a color based on the series' index.

You can set a custom color palette by using the prop `colors` on chart components (or `<ChartContainer />` if you are using composition).
This prop takes an array of colors, or callback whose input is the theme's mode (`'dark'` or `'light'`) and returns the array of colors.

#### Provided palettes

The library includes three palettes.

{{"demo": "MuiColorTemplate.js"}}

#### Custom palettes

Those palettes can also be generated by using [d3-scale-chromatic](https://observablehq.com/@d3/color-schemes).
Or any color manipulation library you like.

Here is an example of the d3 Categorical color palette.

{{"demo": "ColorTemplate.js"}}

### Values color

Colors can also be set according to item values using the `colorMap` property of the corresponding axis.

Learn more about how to use this feature with each chart component in their dedicated docs section:

- [bar charts](/x/react-charts/bars/#color-scale)
- [line charts](/x/react-charts/lines/#color-scale)
- [scatter charts](/x/react-charts/scatter/#color-scale)

The `colorMap` property can accept three kinds of objects defined below.

#### Piecewise color map

The piecewise configuration takes an array of _n_ `thresholds` values and _n+1_ `colors`.

```ts
{
  type: 'piecewise';
  thresholds: Value[];
  colors: string[];
}
```

#### Continuous color map

The continuous configuration lets you map values from `min` to `max` properties to their corresponding colors.

The `color` property can either be an array of two colors to interpolate, or an interpolation function that returns a color corresponding to a number _t_ with a value between 0 and 1.
The [d3-scale-chromatic](https://d3js.org/d3-scale-chromatic) offers a lot of those functions.

Values lower than the `min` get the color of the `min` value; similarly, values higher than the `max` get the color of the `max` value.
By default, the `min`/`max` range is set to 0 / 100.

```ts
{
  type: 'continuous';
  min?: Value;
  max?: Value;
  color: [string, string] | ((t: number) => string);
}
```

#### Ordinal color map

This configuration takes two properties—`values` and `colors`—and maps those values to their respective colors.

If a value is not defined, it will fall back to the `unknownColor`, and if this is also undefined, then it falls back on the series color.

This configuration can be used in Bar Charts to set colors according to string categories.

```ts
{
  type: 'ordinal';
  values: Value[];
  colors: string[];
  unknownColor?: string;
}
```

## Overlay

Charts have a _loading_ and _noData_ overlays that appear if:

- `loading` prop is set to `true`.
- There is no data to display.

{{"demo": "Overlay.js"}}

### Axis display

You can provide the axes data to display them while loading the data.

{{"demo": "OverlayWithAxis.js"}}

### Custom overlay

To modify the overlay message, you can use the `message` props as follows:

```jsx
<BarChart
  slotProps={{
    // Custom loading message
    loadingOverlay: { message: 'Data should be available soon.' },
    // Custom message for empty chart
    noDataOverlay: { message: 'Select some data to display.' },
  }}
/>
```

For more advanced customization, use the `loadingOverlay` and `noDataOverlay` slots link in the following demo.

{{"demo": "CustomOverlay.js"}}

## Styling

### Size

By default, charts adapt their sizing to fill their parent element.
However, you can modify this behavior by providing `height` and/or `width` props.

Those will fix the chart's size to the given value (in px).

### Placement

At the core of chart layout is the drawing area which corresponds to the space available to represent data.

This space can be defined with the `margin` prop and its properties `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.
Those values define the space between the SVG border and the drawing area.

You might want to modify those values to leave more space for your axis ticks or reduce them to provide more space for the data.

{{"demo": "MarginNoSnap.js", "hideToolbar": true, "bg": "playground"}}

### CSS

Since the library relies on SVG for rendering, you can customize them as you do with other MUI System components with CSS overriding.

Chart components accept the `sx` props.
From here, you can target any subcomponents with its class name.

{{"demo": "SxStyling.js"}}

### Gradients and patterns

It is possible to use gradients and patterns to fill the charts.
This can be done by passing your gradient or pattern definition as children of the chart component.

Note that the gradient or pattern defined that way is only usable for SVG.
So a direct definition like `color: "url(#Pattern)'` would cause undefined colors in HTML elements.

{{"demo": "GradientTooltip.js"}}
