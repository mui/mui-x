## Pyramid Chart

To create a pyramid chart, set the `curve` property to `pyramid` in the series.

{{"demo": "Pyramid.js"}}

## Direction

The pyramid automatically changes its direction based on the provided data. If the values are sorted in ascending order, the pyramid is drawn upright.
If the values are sorted in descending order, the pyramid is drawn upside-down.

In order to manually control the direction of the pyramid, the `funnelDirection` property can be set to either `increasing` or `decreasing`.

This is useful when the data is not sorted, or when you want to enforce a specific direction regardless of the data order.

{{"demo": "PyramidDirection.js"}}

## Segments

By default, the pyramid chart creates segments with the same height. To make the segments proportional to the values, set `categoryAxis.scaleType` to `linear`.
This adjusts the height of each segment based on the value it represents.

{{"demo": "PyramidSegmentLinear.js"}}

## Styling

A pyramid chart can be styled in all the same ways as the [funnel chart](/x/react-charts/funnel/#styling).
