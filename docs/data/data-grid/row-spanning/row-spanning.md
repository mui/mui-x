# Data Grid - Row spanning ðŸ§ª

<p class="description">Span cells across several rows.</p>

By default, each cell in a Data Grid takes up the height of one row.
The row spanning feature makes it possible for a cell to fill multiple rows in a single column.

To enable, pass the `rowSpanning` prop to the Data Grid.
The Data Grid will automatically merge consecutive cells with repeating values in the same column, as shown in the demo belowâ€”switch off the toggle button to see the actual rows:

{{"demo": "RowSpanning.js", "bg": "inline", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

:::info
In this demo, the `quantity` column has been deliberately excluded from the row spanning computation using the `colDef.rowSpanValueGetter` prop.

See the [Customizing row-spanning cells](#customizing-row-spanning-cells) section for more details.
:::

:::warning
Row spanning works by increasing the height of the spanned cell by a factor of `rowHeight`â€”it won't work properly with a variable or dynamic height.

## Customizing row-spanning cells

You can customize how row spanning works using two props:

- `colDef.rowSpanValueGetter`: Controls which values are used for row spanning
- `colDef.valueGetter`: Controls both the row spanning logic and the cell value

This lets you prevent unwanted row spanning when there are repeating values that shouldn't be merged.

In the following example, `rowSpanValueGetter` is used to avoid merging `age` cells that don't belong to the same person.

## Usage with column spanning

Row spanning can be used in conjunction with column spanning to create cells that span multiple rows and columns simultaneously, as shown in the demo below:

{{"demo": "RowSpanningClassSchedule.js", "bg": "inline", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

:::warning
Row spanning works well with features like [sorting](/x/react-data-grid/sorting/) and [filtering](/x/react-data-grid/filtering/), but be sure to check that everything works as expected when using it with [column spanning](/x/react-data-grid/column-spanning/).

## Demo

The demo below recreates the calendar from the [column spanning documentation](/x/react-data-grid/column-spanning/#function-signature) using the row spanning feature:
