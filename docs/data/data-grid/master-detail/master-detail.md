# Data Grid - Master-detail row panels [<span class="plan-pro"></span>](/x/introduction/licensing/#pro-plan 'Pro plan')

<p class="description">Implement master-detail row panels to let users view extended information without leaving the Data Grid.</p>

## What is the master-detail pattern?

"Master-detail" is a design pattern for organizing information in which the "master" area lists the data and the "detail" sections provide further information about each item.

The Data Grid Pro provides the tools to implement master-detail row panels.
These are useful whenever you need to give end users additional information about row items without navigating away from the Grid.

A common example of this pattern is found in many email clients—users can click on an email from the master list to see its contents (details) as well as actions they can take such as replying, forwarding, and deleting.
To expand a row, click on the **+** icon or press <kbd class="key">Space</kbd> when focused on a cell in the detail toggle column:

{{"demo": "MasterDetailEmailExample.js", "bg": "inline", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

## Implementing master-detail row panels

To create master-detail row panels, pass a function to the `getDetailPanelContent` prop with the content to be rendered inside the panel.
You can use any valid React element—even another Data Grid.

```tsx
<DataGridPro getDetailPanelContent={({ row }) => <div>Row ID: {row.id}</div>} />
```

### Detail panel height

By default, the detail panel height is 500px.
You can customize this by passing a function to the `getDetailPanelHeight` prop.
This function must return either a number or `"auto"`:

- If it returns a number, then the panel will use that value (in pixels) for the height.
- If it returns `"auto"`, then the height will be derived from the content.

```tsx

// fixed height:
<DataGridPro
  getDetailPanelContent={({ row }) => <div>Row ID: {row.id}</div>}
  getDetailPanelHeight={({ row }) => 100}
/>

// height derived from content:
<DataGridPro
  getDetailPanelContent={({ row }) => <div>Row ID: {row.id}</div>}
  getDetailPanelHeight={({ row }) => 'auto'}
/>
```

:::info
The `getDetailPanelContent` and `getDetailPanelHeight` props are called with a [`GridRowParams`](/x/api/data-grid/grid-row-params/) object, which lets you return a different value for each row.
:::

The demo below shows master-detail panels with heights derived from their contents:

{{"demo": "DetailPanelAutoHeight.js", "bg": "inline", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

:::warning
Always memoize the function provided to `getDetailPanelContent` and `getDetailPanelHeight`.
The Data Grid depends on the referential value of these props to cache their values and optimize the rendering.

```tsx
const getDetailPanelContent = React.useCallback(() => { ... }, []);

<DataGridPro getDetailPanelContent={getDetailPanelContent} />
```

:::

## Controlling expanded detail panels

To control which rows are expanded, pass a set of row IDs to the `detailPanelExpandedRowIds` prop.
You can pass a callback function to the `onDetailPanelExpandedRowIds` prop to detect when a row is expanded or collapsed.

To initialize the Data Grid with specific row panels expanded, use the `initialState` prop as shown below:

```tsx
<DataGridPro initialState={{ detailPanel: { expandedRowIds: new Set([1, 2, 3]) } }}>
```

{{"demo": "ControlMasterDetail.js", "bg": "inline", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

## Lazy-loading detail panel content

You don't need to provide the content for detail panels upfront—instead, you can load it lazily when a row is expanded.

In the following example, the `<DetailPanelContent />` component fetches data on mount.
This component is used by the `getDetailPanelContent` prop to render the detail panel content.

{{"demo": "LazyLoadingDetailPanel.js", "bg": "inline", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

## Using a detail panel as a form

As an alternative to the built-in [row editing feature](/x/react-data-grid/editing/#row-editing), you can render a form component inside the detail panel so users can edit the row values.

The demo below shows how to implement this behavior using [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/), but other form libraries are also supported.

{{"demo": "FormDetailPanel.js", "bg": "inline", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

## Customizing the detail panel toggle

To change the icon used for the toggle, you can provide a different component for the [icon slot](/x/react-data-grid/components/#icons) as shown here:

```tsx
<DataGridPro
  slots={{
    detailPanelExpandIcon: CustomExpandIcon,
    detailPanelCollapseIcon: CustomCollapseIcon,
  }}
/>
```

You can also completely override the toggle component by adding another column to your set with `field: GRID_DETAIL_PANEL_TOGGLE_FIELD`.
This prevents the Data Grid from adding the default toggle column.
Then you can add a new toggle component using [`renderCell()`](/x/react-data-grid/column-definition/#rendering-cells) as you would for any other column:

```tsx
<DataGridPro
  columns={[
    {
      field: GRID_DETAIL_PANEL_TOGGLE_FIELD,
      renderCell: (params) => <CustomDetailPanelToggle {...params} />,
    },
  ]}
/>
```

Because the `field` is the only property defined, it's up to you to configure any additional options (such as filtering, sorting, or disabling the column menu).
If you'd rather set up the toggle with basic options preconfigured, you can spread `GRID_DETAIL_PANEL_TOGGLE_COL_DEF` when defining the column, as shown below:

```tsx
<DataGridPro
  columns={[
    {
      ...GRID_DETAIL_PANEL_TOGGLE_COL_DEF, // Already contains the right field
      renderCell: (params) => <CustomDetailPanelToggle {...params}>
    },
  ]}
/>
```

You can also use this approach to change the location of the toggle column, as shown in the demo below:

{{"demo": "CustomizeDetailPanelToggle.js", "bg": "inline", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

:::info
As with any other cell renderer, the `value` prop is also available, and it corresponds to the state of the row: it's set to `true` when expanded and `false` when collapsed.
:::

## Customizing the detail panel column header

To render a custom header for the detail panel column, use the [`renderHeader`](/x/react-data-grid/column-header/#custom-header-renderer) property in the column definition.
This property receives a `GridRenderHeaderParams` object that contains `colDef` (the column definition) and `field`.
The snippet below shows how to do this:

```tsx
const columns = [
  {
    ...GRID_DETAIL_PANEL_TOGGLE_COL_DEF,
    renderHeader: (params) => (
      <div>
        <span>{params.colDef.headerName}</span>
        <button onClick={() => console.log('Custom action')}>Custom action</button>
      </div>
    ),
  },
  //... other columns
];
```

:::success
For a more complex example of this use case, see the recipe for [expanding or collapsing all detail panels](/x/react-data-grid/row-recipes/#expand-or-collapse-all-detail-panels).
:::

## Disabling detail panel content scroll

By default, the detail panel's width is equal to the sum of the widths of all columns.
This means that when a horizontal scrollbar is present, scrolling it also scrolls the panel content.
To avoid this behavior, set the size of the detail panel to the outer size of the Data Grid.
Use `apiRef.current.getRootDimensions()` to get the latest dimension values.
And to prevent the panel from scrolling, set `position: sticky` and `left: 0`.

The following demo shows how to accomplish this—notice that the toggle column is pinned so it remains visible when the user scrolls horizontally:

{{"demo": "FullWidthDetailPanel.js", "bg": "inline", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

## apiRef

The Data Grid exposes a set of methods via the `apiRef` object that are used internally in the implementation of master-detail row panels.
The reference below describes the relevant functions.
See [API object](/x/react-data-grid/api-object/) for more details.

:::warning
This API should only be used as a last resort when the Data Grid's built-in props aren't sufficient for your specific use case.
