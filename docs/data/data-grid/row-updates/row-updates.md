# Data grid - Row updates

<p class="description">Always keep your rows up to date.</p>

## The `rows` prop

The simplest way to update the rows is to provide the new rows using the `rows` prop.
It replaces the previous values. This approach has some drawbacks:

- You need to provide all the rows.
- You might create a performance bottleneck when preparing the rows array to provide to the grid.

## The `updateRows` method [<span class="plan-pro"></span>](/x/introduction/licensing/#pro-plan)

If you want to only update part of the rows, you can use the `apiRef.current.updateRows` method.

{{"demo": "UpdateRowsApiRef.js", "bg": "inline", "disableAd": true}}

The default behavior of `updateRows` API is to upsert rows.
So if a row has an id that is not in the current list of rows then it will be added to the grid.

Alternatively, if you would like to delete a row, you would need to pass an extra `_action` property in the update object as below.

```ts
apiRef.current.updateRows([{ id: 1, _action: 'delete' }]);
```

## Infinite loading [<span class="plan-pro"></span>](/x/introduction/licensing/#pro-plan)

The grid provides a `onRowsScrollEnd` prop that can be used to load additional rows when the scroll reaches the bottom of the viewport area.

In addition, the area in which `onRowsScrollEnd` is called can be changed using `scrollEndThreshold`.

## High frequency [<span class="plan-pro"></span>](/x/introduction/licensing/#pro-plan)

Whenever the rows are updated, the grid has to apply the sorting and filters. This can be a problem if you have high frequency updates. To maintain good performances, the grid allows to batch the updates and only apply them after a period of time. The `throttleRowsMs` prop can be used to define the frequency (in milliseconds) at which rows updates are applied.

When receiving updates more frequently than this threshold, the grid will wait before updating the rows.

The following demo updates the rows every 10 ms, but they are only applied every 2 seconds.
