# Data Grid - Pagination

<p class="description">Easily paginate your rows and only fetch what you need.</p>

## Enabling pagination

The default pagination behavior depends on your plan:

:::info
Exported CSV and Excel files include all data and disregard pagination by default.
To apply pagination to exported files, review the available [row selectors](/x/react-data-grid/export/#exported-rows).
:::

### Community plan

For the Community Data Grid, pagination is enabled by default and cannot be disabled.

{{"demo": "PaginationCommunityNoSnap.js", "bg": "inline"}}

### Pro [<span class="plan-pro"></span>](/x/introduction/licensing/#pro-plan 'Pro plan') and Premium [<span class="plan-premium"></span>](/x/introduction/licensing/#premium-plan 'Premium plan')

For the Pro and Premium Data Grid, pagination is disabled by default; use the `pagination` prop to enable it.

{{"demo": "PageSizeAutoPremium.js", "bg": "inline"}}

## Size of the page

The Data Grid (MIT license) is limited to pages of up to 100 rows.
If you want larger pages, you will need to upgrade to [Pro plan](/x/introduction/licensing/#pro-plan) or above.

By default, each page contains 100 rows. The user can change the size of the page through the selector in the footer.

### Page size options

You can customize the options shown in the "Rows per page" select using the `pageSizeOptions` prop.
You should provide an array of items, each item should be one of these types:

- **number**, each number will be used for the option's label and value.

  ```jsx
  <DataGrid pageSizeOptions={[5, 10, 25]}>
  ```

- **object**, the `value` and `label` keys will be used respectively for the value and label of the option. Define `value` as `-1` to display all results.

  ```jsx
  <DataGrid pageSizeOptions={[10, 100, { value: 1000, label: '1,000' }, { value: -1, label: 'All' }]}>
  ```

{{"demo": "PageSizeCustomOptions.js", "bg": "inline"}}

### Automatic page size

Use the `autoPageSize` prop to auto-scale the `pageSize` to match the container height and the max number of rows that can be displayed without a vertical scroll bar.

:::warning
You cannot use both the `autoPageSize` and `autoHeight` props at the same time because `autoHeight` scales the height of the Data Grid according to the `pageSize`.
:::

{{"demo": "PageSizeAuto.js", "bg": "inline"}}

## Pagination model

The pagination model is an object containing the current page and the size of the page. The default value is `{ page: 0, pageSize: 100 }`. To change the default value, make it controlled by `paginationModel` prop or initialize a custom value using `initialState.pagination.paginationModel`.

### Initializing the pagination model

To initialize the pagination model without controlling it, provide the `paginationModel` to the `initialState` prop. If you don't provide a value for one of the properties, the default value will be used.

```tsx
<DataGrid
  initialState={{
    pagination: {
      paginationModel: { pageSize: 25, page: 0 },
    },
  }}
/>
```

{{"demo": "PaginationModelInitialState.js", "bg": "inline"}}

### Controlled pagination model

Pass the `paginationModel` prop to control the size and current page of the grid. You can use the `onPaginationModelChange` prop to listen to changes to the `paginationModel` and update the prop accordingly.

```tsx
const [paginationModel, setPaginationModel] = React.useState({
  pageSize: 25,
  page: 0,
});

<DataGrid
  paginationModel={paginationModel}
  onPaginationModelChange={setPaginationModel}
/>;
```

{{"demo": "PaginationModelControlled.js", "bg": "inline"}}

## Server-side pagination

By default, the pagination is handled on the client.
This means you have to give the rows of all pages to the Data Grid.
If your dataset is too big, and you want to fetch the pages on demand, you can use server-side pagination.

In general, the server-side pagination could be categorized into two types:

- Index-based pagination
- Cursor-based pagination

:::info
Check out [Selection‚ÄîUsage with server-side pagination](/x/react-data-grid/row-selection/#usage-with-server-side-pagination) for more details.
:::

### Index-based pagination

The index-based pagination uses the `page` and `pageSize` to fetch the data from the server page by page.

To enable server-side pagination, you need to:

- Set the `paginationMode` prop to `server`
- Use the `onPaginationModelChange` prop to react to the page changes and load the data from the server

The server-side pagination can be further categorized into sub-types based on the availability of the total number of rows or `rowCount`.

The Data Grid uses the `rowCount` to calculate the number of pages and to show the information about the current state of the pagination in the footer.
You can provide the `rowCount` in one of the following ways:

- **Initialize.**
  Use the `initialState.pagination.rowCount` prop to initialize the `rowCount`.
- **Control.**
  Use the `rowCount` prop along with `onRowCountChange` to control the `rowCount` and reflect the changes when the row count is updated.
- **Set using the API.**
  Use the `apiRef.current.setRowCount` method to set the `rowCount` after the Grid is initialized.

There can be three different possibilities regarding the availability of the `rowCount` on the server-side:

1. Row count is available (known)
2. Row count is not available (unknown)
3. Row count is available but is not accurate and may update later on (estimated)

:::warning
The `rowCount` prop is used in server-side pagination mode to inform the DataGrid about the total number of rows in your dataset.
This prop is ignored when the `paginationMode` is set to `client`, that is when the pagination is handled on the client-side.
:::

You can configure `rowCount`, `paginationMeta.hasNextPage`, and `estimatedRowCount` props to handle the above scenarios.

|                     | `rowCount` | `paginationMeta.hasNextPage` | `estimatedRowCount` |
| :------------------ | :--------- | :--------------------------- | :------------------ |
| Known row count     | `number`   | ‚Äî                            | ‚Äî                   |
| Unknown row count   | `-1`       | `boolean`                    | ‚Äî                   |
| Estimated row count | `-1`       | `boolean`                    | `number`            |

#### Known row count

Pass the props to the Data Grid as explained in the table above to handle the case when the actual row count is known, as the following example demonstrates.

{{"demo": "ServerPaginationGrid.js", "bg": "inline"}}

:::warning
If the value `rowCount` becomes `undefined` during loading, it will reset the page to zero.
To avoid this issue, you can memoize the `rowCount` value to ensure it doesn't change during loading:

```jsx
const rowCountRef = React.useRef(pageInfo?.totalRowCount || 0);

const rowCount = React.useMemo(() => {
  if (pageInfo?.totalRowCount !== undefined) {
    rowCountRef.current = pageInfo.totalRowCount;
  }
  return rowCountRef.current;
}, [pageInfo?.totalRowCount]);

<DataGrid rowCount={rowCount} />;
```

:::

#### Unknown row count

Pass the props to the Data Grid as explained in the table above to handle the case when the actual row count is unknown, as the following example demonstrates.

{{"demo": "ServerPaginationGridNoRowCount.js", "bg": "inline"}}

:::warning
The value of the `hasNextPage` variable might become `undefined` during loading if it's handled by some external fetching hook resulting in unwanted computations, one possible solution could be to memoize the `paginationMeta`:

```tsx
const paginationMetaRef = React.useRef<GridPaginationMeta>();

const paginationMeta = React.useMemo(() => {
  if (
    hasNextPage !== undefined &&
    paginationMetaRef.current?.hasNextPage !== hasNextPage
  ) {
    paginationMetaRef.current = { hasNextPage };
  }
  return paginationMetaRef.current;
}, [hasNextPage]);
```

:::

#### Estimated row count

Estimated row count could be considered a hybrid approach that switches between the "Known row count" and "Unknown row count" use cases.

Initially, when an `estimatedRowCount` is set and `rowCount={-1}`, the Data Grid behaves as in the "Unknown row count" use case, but with the `estimatedRowCount` value shown in the pagination footer.

If the number of rows loaded exceeds the `estimatedRowCount`, the Data Grid ignores the `estimatedRowCount` and the behavior is identical to the "Unknown row count" use case.

When the `hasNextPage` returns `false` or `rowCount` is set to a positive number, the Data Grid switches to the "Known row count" behavior.

In the following example, the actual row count is `1000` but the Data Grid is initially provided with `estimatedRowCount={100}`.
You can set the `rowCount` to the actual row count by pressing the "Set Row Count" button.

{{"demo": "ServerPaginationGridEstimated.js", "bg": "inline"}}

:::warning
The `hasNextPage` must not be set to `false` until there are _actually_ no records left to fetch, because when `hasNextPage` becomes `false`, the Grid considers this as the last page and tries to set the `rowCount` value to a finite value.

If an external data fetching library sets the values to undefined during loading, you can memoize the `paginationMeta` value to ensure it doesn't change during loading as shown in the "Unknown row count" section.
:::

:::info

üåç **Localization of the estimated row count**

The Data Grid uses the [Table Pagination](/material-ui/api/table-pagination/) component from the Material¬†UI library which doesn't support `estimated` row count. Until this is supported natively by the Table Pagination component, a workaround to make the localization work is to provide the `labelDisplayedRows` function to the `localeText.MuiTablePagination` property as per the locale you are interested in.

The Grid injects an additional variable `estimated` to the `labelDisplayedRows` function which you can use to accommodate the estimated row count.
The following example demonstrates how to show the estimated row count in the pagination footer in the Croatian (hr-HR) language.

```jsx
const labelDisplayedRows = ({ from, to, count, estimated }) => {
  if (!estimated) {
    return `${from}‚Äì${to} od ${count !== -1 ? count : `vi≈°e nego ${to}`}`;
  }
  const estimateLabel =
    estimated && estimated > to ? `oko ${estimated}` : `vi≈°e nego ${to}`;
  return `${from}‚Äì${to} od ${count !== -1 ? count : estimateLabel}`;
};

<DataGrid
  {...data}
  localeText={{
    MuiTablePagination: {
      labelDisplayedRows,
    },
  }}
/>;
```

For more information, see the [Translation keys](/x/react-data-grid/localization/#translation-keys) section of the localization documentation.

### Cursor-based pagination

You can also handle servers with cursor-based pagination.
To do so, you just have to keep track of the next cursor associated with each page you fetched.

{{"demo": "CursorPaginationGrid.js", "bg": "inline", "defaultCodeOpen": false }}

## Custom pagination UI

You can customize the rendering of the pagination in the footer following [the component section](/x/react-data-grid/components/#pagination) of the documentation.

## apiRef

The Data Grid exposes a set of methods that enables all of these features using the imperative `apiRef`. To know more about how to use it, check the [API Object](/x/react-data-grid/api-object/) section.

:::warning
Only use this API as the last option. Give preference to the props to control the Data Grid.
