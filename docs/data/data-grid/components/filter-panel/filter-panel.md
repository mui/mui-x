# Data Grid - Filter Panel ðŸš§

<p class="description">Customize the Data Grid's filter panel.</p>

:::warning
This component is incomplete.

Currently, the Trigger is the only composable part of the Filter Panel available.
Future versions of the Filter Panel component will make it possible to compose each of its parts to create a custom filter panel.

In the meantime, it's still possible to deeply customize the panel's subcomponents using custom slots.
See [Filter customizationâ€”Custom filter panel](/x/react-data-grid/filtering/customization/#custom-filter-panel)
for more details.

:::

## Basic usage

The demo below shows how to add a filter panel trigger to a custom toolbar.

{{"demo": "GridFilterPanelTrigger.js", "bg": "inline", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

## Anatomy

```tsx
import { FilterPanel } from '@mui/x-data-grid';

<FilterPanel.Trigger />;
```

### Trigger

`Trigger` is a button that opens/closes the filter panel.
It renders the `baseButton` slot.

## Custom elements

Use the `render` prop to replace default elements.
See [Componentsâ€”Usage](/x/react-data-grid/components/usage/#customization) for more details, and [Toolbarâ€”Custom elements demo](/x/react-data-grid/components/toolbar/#custom-elements) for an example of a custom Filter Panel Trigger.

## Accessibility

### ARIA

You must apply a text label or an `aria-label` attribute to the `<FilterPanel.Trigger />`.
