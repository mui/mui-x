# Data Grid - Filter Panel ðŸš§

<p class="description">Customize the Data Grid's filter panel.</p>

:::warning
This component is incomplete.

Currently, the Filter Panel Trigger is the only part of the Filter Panel component available.
Future versions of the Filter Panel component will make it possible to compose each of its parts to create a custom filter panel.

In the meantime, it's still possible to deeply customize the panel's subcomponents using custom slots.
See [Filter customizationâ€”Custom filter panel](/x/react-data-grid/filtering/customization/#custom-filter-panel)
for more details.

:::

## Basic usage

The demo below shows how to add a filter panel trigger to a custom toolbar.

{{"demo": "GridFilterPanelTrigger.js", "bg": "inline", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

## Anatomy

```tsx
import { FilterPanelTrigger } from '@mui/x-data-grid';

<FilterPanelTrigger />;
```

### Filter Panel Trigger

`<FilterPanelTrigger />` is a button that opens and closes the filter panel.
It renders the `baseButton` slot.

## Custom elements

Use the `render` prop to replace default elements.
See [Components usageâ€”Customization](/x/react-data-grid/components/usage/#customization) for more details, and [Toolbarâ€”Custom elements demo](/x/react-data-grid/components/toolbar/#custom-elements) for an example of a custom Filter Panel Trigger.

## Accessibility

### ARIA

You must apply a text label or an `aria-label` attribute to the `<FilterPanelTrigger />`.
