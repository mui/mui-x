# Data Grid - Column groups

<p class="description">Group your columns.</p>

Grouping columns allows you to have a multi-level hierarchy of columns in your header.

## Define column groups

You can define column groups with the `columnGroupingModel` prop.
This prop receives an array of column groups.

A column group is defined by at least two properties:

- `groupId`: a string used to identify the group
- `children`: an array containing the children of the group

The `children` attribute can contain two types of objects:

- leafs with type `{ field: string }`, which add the column with the corresponding `field` to this group.
- other column groups which allows you to have nested groups.

:::warning
A column can only be associated with one group.

```jsx
<DataGrid
  columnGroupingModel={[
    {
      groupId: 'internal data',
      children: [{ field: 'id' }],
    },
    {
      groupId: 'character',
      children: [
        {
          groupId: 'naming',
          children: [{ field: 'lastName' }, { field: 'firstName' }],
        },
        { field: 'age' },
      ],
    },
  ]}
/>
```

## Customize column group

In addition to the required `groupId` and `children`, you can use the following optional properties to customize a column group:

- `headerName`: the string displayed as the column's name (instead of `groupId`).
- `description`: a text for the tooltip.
- `headerClassName`: a CSS class for styling customization.
- `renderHeaderGroup`: a function returning custom React component.

## Group header height

By default, column group headers are the same height as¬†[column headers](/x/react-data-grid/column-header/#header-height). This will be the default 56 pixels or a custom value set with the `columnHeaderHeight` prop.

The `columnGroupHeaderHeight` prop can be used to size column group headers independently of column headers.

## Column reordering [<span class="plan-pro"></span>](/x/introduction/licensing/#pro-plan 'Pro plan')

By default, the columns that are part of a group cannot be dragged to outside their group.
You can customize this behavior on specific groups by setting `freeReordering: true` in a column group object.

In the example below, the `Full name` column group can be divided, but not other column groups.

{{"demo": "BreakingGroupDemo.js", "disableAd": true, "bg": "inline"}}

## Collapsible column groups

The demo below uses [`renderHeaderGroup`](/x/react-data-grid/column-groups/#customize-column-group) to add a button to collapse/expand the column group.

With this feature, users would be able to expand and collapse grouped columns to toggle their visibility.

With this feature, users would be able to drag and drop grouped headers to move all grouped children at once (which is [already possible for normal columns](/x/react-data-grid/column-ordering/)).
