<p class="description">Rearrange rows and columns to view data from multiple perspectives.</p>

:::success
Pivoting is available in MUIÂ X v8+.
You must [upgrade from v7](https://mui.com/x/migration/migration-data-grid-v7/) to use this feature.
:::

The Data Grid Premium's pivoting feature lets users transform the data in their grid by reorganizing rows and columns, creating dynamic cross-tabulations of data.
This makes it possible to analyze data from different angles and gain insights that would be difficult to see in the default grid view.
