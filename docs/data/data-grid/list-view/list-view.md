# Data Grid - List view [<span class="plan-pro"></span>](/x/introduction/licensing/#pro-plan 'Pro plan')🧪

<p class="description">Display data in a single-column list view. Can be used to present a more compact grid on smaller screens and mobile devices.</p>

:::warning
This feature is marked as **unstable**. While you can use this feature in production, the API could change in the future.
:::

List view can be enabled by providing the `unstable_listView` prop.

Unlike the default grid view, the list view makes no assumptions on how data is presented to end users.

In order to display data in a list view, a `unstable_listColumn` prop must be provided with a `renderCell` function.

```tsx
function ListViewCell(params: GridRenderCellParams) {
  return <>{params.row.id}</>;
}

const listColDef: GridListColDef = {
  field: 'listColumn',
  renderCell: ListViewCell,
};

<DataGridPro unstable_listColumn={listColDef} unstable_listView={true} />;
```

{{"demo": "ListView.js", "bg": true}}

## Enable with a media query

Use the `useMediaQuery` hook from `@mui/material` to enable the list view feature at a specified breakpoint.

The demo below automatically switches to a list layout when the viewport width is below the `md` breakpoint.

{{"demo": "ListViewMediaQuery.js", "bg": "inline"}}

## Editable rows

The [editing feature](/x/react-data-grid/editing/) is not supported in list view, but it is possible to build an editing experience from within your custom cell renderer, as shown below.

{{"demo": "ListViewEdit.js", "bg": true}}

## Advanced usage

The list view feature can be combined with [custom subcomponents](/x/react-data-grid/components/) to provide an improved user experience on small screens, as shown below.

{{"demo": "ListViewAdvanced.js", "iframe": true, "maxWidth": 360, "height": 600}}
