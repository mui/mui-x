# Data Grid - Scrolling

<p class="description">This section presents how to programmatically control the scroll.</p>

## Scrolling to specific cells

You can scroll to a specific cell by calling `apiRef.current.scrollToIndexes()`.
The only argument that must be passed is an object containing the row index and the column index of the cell to scroll.
If the row or column index is not present, the data grid will not do any movement in the missing axis.

The following demo explores the usage of this API:

{{"demo": "ScrollPlayground.js", "bg": "inline"}}

## apiRef

The grid exposes a set of methods that enables all of these features using the imperative `apiRef`. To know more about how to use it, check the [API Object](/x/react-data-grid/api-object/) section.

:::warning
Only use this API as the last option. Give preference to the props to control the Data Grid.

{{"demo": "ScrollApiNoSnap.js", "bg": "inline", "hideToolbar": true}}
