# Personal AGENTS.md configuration

<!--
  HOW TO USE:
  1. Copy this file to AGENTS.local.md: `cp AGENTS.local.md.template AGENTS.local.md`
  2. AGENTS.local.md is gitignored - your personal preferences stay local
  3. Add your own notes, shortcuts, and context below
  4. If you already have your own CLAUDE.md – just rename the file to AGENTS.local.md

  HOW IT WORKS:
  - AGENTS.md (in the repo) contains shared team conventions and project knowledge
  - AGENTS.local.md (this file, after copying) contains your personal preferences
  - Both files are loaded together - you don't need to duplicate shared content
