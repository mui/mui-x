<h1 align="center">MUI X</h1>

MUI X is a collection of advanced UI components that are significantly more complex than the ones found in the [MUI Core](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/) libraries.
They feature state-of-the-art functionality and complex UX workflows for data-rich applications, and support a wide range of use cases.

MUI X is **open core**—base components are MIT-licensed, while more advanced features require a Pro or Premium commercial license.
See the [Licensing page](https://mui.com/x/introduction/licensing/) for details.

## MIT vs. commercial licenses

MUI has been building MIT-licensed React components since 2014, and we are committed to the continued advancement of the open-source libraries.
Anything we release under an MIT license will remain MIT-licensed forever.
You can learn more about our stewardship ethos in [this document from our company handbook](https://mui-org.notion.site/Stewardship-542a2226043d4f4a96dfb429d16cf5bd).

We offer commercial licenses to developers who need the most advanced features that cannot be easily maintained by the open-source community.
Commercial licenses enable us to support a full-time staff of engineers, which is simply not possible through the MIT model.

Rest assured that when we release features commercially, it's only because we believe that you will not find a better MIT-licensed alternative anywhere else.

See the [Pricing](https://mui.com/pricing/) page for a detailed feature comparison.
