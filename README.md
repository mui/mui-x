[MUI X](https://mui.com/x/) is a suite of advanced React UI components for a wide range of complex use cases.
Each component provides best-in-class UX and DX, with sophisticated UX workflows for data-rich applications.
Components include the Data Grid, Date and Time Pickers, Charts, and Tree View.

MUI X extends the core functionality of [Material UI](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/), but the advanced components also stand on their own and can be fully customized to meet the needs of any design system.

MUI X is **open-core**: [Community](#community-plan) components are MIT-licensed and free forever, while more advanced features and components require a [Pro](#pro-plan) or [Premium](#premium-plan) commercial license.
See [Licensing](#licensing) for more information.

## Licensing

The MUI X team has been building MIT-licensed React components since 2014, starting with Material UI, and we're committed to the continued advancement of our open-source libraries.
Anything we release under an MIT license will remain MIT-licensed forever.
Learn more about [our stewardship ethos](https://mui-org.notion.site/Stewardship-542a2226043d4f4a96dfb429d16cf5bd).

We offer commercial licenses to developers who need the most advanced components and features that can't reasonably be maintained by the open-source community alone.
These licenses make it possible for us to support a full-time staff of engineers.

Rest assured that when we release features commercially, it's only because we believe you won't find a better MIT-licensed alternative anywhere else.

See the [Licensing page](https://mui.com/x/introduction/licensing/) for complete details.

### Plans

#### Community plan

The free Community version of MUI X contains components and features that we believe are maintainable by contributions from the open-source community.
It's published under an [MIT license](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license) and it's [free forever](https://mui-org.notion.site/Stewardship-542a2226043d4f4a96dfb429d16cf5bd#20f609acab4441cf9346614119fbbac1).
